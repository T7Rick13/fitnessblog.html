<h1>Infinite Remodeling is a service of Oklahoma and North East Texas.

<p>Infinite Remodeling started in Northeast Oklahoma. I was fortunate I met professionals in the industri I was a part of and had some excellent mentors. I was on down times. I became aware, then educated through experience and knowledge of Tulsas growing home improvement market and housing economy.I was able to get connected to commercial, apartment, maintenance and private Remodel jobs. This gave me the opportunity to learn new skills and hone my craft to build on what I already knew about building and Construction from the oilfield and fabrication industries.
